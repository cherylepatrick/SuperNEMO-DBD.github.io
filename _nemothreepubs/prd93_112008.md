abstract: 
  The NEMO-3 experiment at the Modane Underground Laboratory investigates the double-beta decay of $^{48}$Ca. Using 5.25 yr of data recorded with a 6.99 g sample of $^{48}$Ca, approximately 150 double-beta decay candidate events are selected with a signal-to-background ratio greater than 3. The half-life for the two-neutrino double-beta decay of $^{48}$Ca is measured to be $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[6.4 ^{+0.7}_{-0.6}(\textrm{stat})^{+1.2}_{-0.9} (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{19}$ yr. A search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{48}$Ca yields a null result, and a corresponding lower limit on the half-life is found to be $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}\geq 2.0\times 10^{22}$ at 90% confidence level, translating into an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of $\left < m_{\beta\beta} \right > \leq 6.0-26$ eV, with the range reflecting different nuclear matrix element calculations. Limits are also set on models involving Majoron emission and right-handed currents.
