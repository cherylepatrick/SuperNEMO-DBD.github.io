abstract: 
  In the double beta decay experiment NEMO 3 a precise knowledge of the background in the signal region is of outstanding importance. This article presents the methods used in NEMO 3 to evaluate the backgrounds resulting from most if not all possible origins. It also illustrates the power of the combined tracking-calorimetry technique used in the experiment.
