abstract: 
  The double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo to the $0_1^+$ and $2_1^+$  excited states of $^{100}$Ru  is studied using the NEMO 3 data. After the analysis of 8024 h of data the half-life for the two-neutrino double beta decay of  $^{100}$Mo to the excited $0_1^+$ state is measured to be $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[5.7 ^{+1.3}_{-0.9}(\textrm{stat})\pm0.8 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{20} \textrm{y}$. The signal-to-background ratio is equal to 3. Information about energy and angular distributions of emitted electrons is also obtained. No evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay to the excited $0_1^+$ state has been found. The corresponding half-life limit is $T_{1/2}^{(0\nu)}(0^+ \to 0_1^+)>8.9\times 10^{22}$ y (at 90% C.L.). The search for the double beta decay to the $2_1^+$ excited state has allowed the determination of limits on the half-life for the two neutrino mode $T_{1/2}^{(2\nu)}(0^+ \to 2_1^+)>1.1\times 10^{21}$ y (at 90% C.L.) and for the neutrinoless mode $T_{1/2}^{(0\nu)}(0^+ \to 2_1^+)>1.6\times 10^{23}$ y (at 90% C.L.).
