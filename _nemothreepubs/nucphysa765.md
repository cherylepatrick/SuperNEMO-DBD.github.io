abstract: 
  The NEMO-3 tracking detector is located in the Fréjus  Underground Laboratory. It was designed to study double beta decay in a number of different isotopes. Presented here are the experimental half-life limits on the double beta decay process for the isotopes $^{100}$Mo and $^{82}$Se for different majoron emission modes and limits on the effective neutrino–majoron coupling constants. In particular, new limits on “ordinary” majoron (spectral index 1) decay of $^{100}$Mo $(T_{1/2}>2.7\times 10^{22}\textrm{yr})$ and $^{82}$Se $(T_{1/2}>1.5\times 10^{22}\textrm{yr})$ have been obtained. Corresponding bounds on the majoron–neutrino coupling constant are $\left < g_{ee} \right > <0.4-1.8\times 10^{-4}$ and $<0.66-1.9\times 10^{-4}$.
