abstract: 
  Double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo to the excited states of daughter nuclei has been studied using a 600 cm$^3$ low-background HPGe detector and an external source consisting of 2588 g of 97.5% enriched metallic  $^{100}$Mo, which was formerly inside the NEMO-3 detector and used for the NEMO-3 measurements of $^{100}$Mo. The half-life for the two-neutrino double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo to the excited $0_1^+$ state in $^{100}$Ru is measured to be $T_{1/2} = \left[7.5 \pm 0.6(\textrm{stat})\pm 0.6 (\textrm{syst})\right]\cdot 10^{20}$ yr. For other ($0\nu + 2 \nu$) transitions to the $2_1^+$, $2_2^+$, $0_2^+$, $2_3^+$ and $0_3^+$ levels in $^{100}$Ru, limits are obtained at the level of $~(0.25-1.1)\cdot 10^{22}$ yr.
