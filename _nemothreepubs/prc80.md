abstract: 
  The half-life for double-$\beta$ decay of $^{150}$Nd has been measured by the NEMO-3 experiment at the Modane Underground Laboratory. Using 924.7 days of data recorded with 36.55g of $^{150}$Nd, we measured the half-life for 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay to be $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[9.11 ^{+0.25}_{-0.22}(\textrm{stat})\pm0.63 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{18} \textrm{yr}$. The observed limit on the half-life for neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay is found to be $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}>1.8\times 10^{22}$  yr at 90% confidence level. This translates into a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of $\left < m_\nu \right > <4.0-6.3$ eV if the nuclear deformation is taken into account. We also set limits on models involving Majoron emission, right-handed currents, and transitions to excited states.
