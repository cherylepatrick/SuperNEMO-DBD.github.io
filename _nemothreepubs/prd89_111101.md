abstract: 
  We report the results of a search for the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) of $^{100}$Mo, using the NEMO-3 detector to reconstruct the full topology of the final state events. With an exposure of 34.7 kg y, no evidence for the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ signal has been found, yielding a limit for the light Majorana neutrino mass mechanism of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}> 1.1\times 10^{24}$ years (90% C.L.) once both statistical and systematic uncertainties are taken into account. Depending on the nuclear matrix elements this corresponds to an upper limit on the Majorana effective neutrino mass of $\left < m_\nu \right > < 0.3-0.9$ eV (90% C.L.). Constraints on other lepton number violating mechanisms of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decays are also given. Searching for high-energy double electron events in all suitable sources of the detector, no event in the energy region [3.2â€“10] MeV is observed for an exposure of $47 \textrm{kg}\cdot\textrm{y}$.
