abstract:
  We report results from the NEMO-3 experiment based on an exposure of 1275 days with 661 g of $^{130}$Te in the form of enriched and natural tellurium foils. The $\beta\beta$ decay rate of $^{130}$Te is found to be greater than zero with a significance of 7.7 standard deviations and the half-life is measured to be $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[7.0 \pm 0.9(\textrm{stat})\pm 1.1 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{20} \textrm{yr}$. This represents the most precise measurement of this half-life yet published and the first real-time observation of this decay.
