  The NEMO-3 experiment measured the half-life of the 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay and searched for the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{116}$Cd. Using 410 g of $^{116}$Cd installed in the detector with an exposure of 5.26 y, (4968$\pm$74) events corresponding to the 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{116}$Cd to the ground state of $^{116}$Sn have been observed with a signal to background ratio of about 12. The half-life of the 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay has been measured to be $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[2.74 \pm 0.04(\textrm{stat}) \pm0.18 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{19}$ y. No events have been observed above the expected background while searching for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay. The corresponding limit on the half-life is determined to be $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}\geq 1.0\times 10^{23}$ y at the 90 C.L. which corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of $\left < m_\nu \right > \leq 1.4-2.5$ eV depending on the nuclear matrix elements considered. Limits on other mechanisms generating 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay such as the exchange of R-parity violating supersymmetric particles, right-handed currents and majoron emission are also obtained.
