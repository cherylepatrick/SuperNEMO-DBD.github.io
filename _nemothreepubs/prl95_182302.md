abstract:
  The NEMO 3 detector, which has been operating in the Fr√©jus underground laboratory since February 2003, is devoted to the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($\beta\beta$0$\nu$). The half-lives of the two neutrino double beta decay ($\beta\beta 2 \nu$) have been measured for $^{100}$Mo and $^{82}$Se. After 389 effective days of data collection from February 2003 until September 2004 (Phase~I), no evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay was found from $\sim$7 kg of $^{100}$Mo and $\sim$1 kg of $^{82}$Se. The corresponding lower limits for the half-lives are $4.6 \times 10^{23}$ years for $^{100}$Mo and $1.0 \times 10^{23}$ years for  $^{82}$Se (90\% C.L.). Depending on the nuclear matrix element calculation, the limits for the effective Majorana neutrino mass are $\langle m_{\nu} \rangle < 0.7-2.8$ eV for $^{100}$Mo and $\langle m_{\nu} \rangle < 1.7-4.9$ eV for $^{82}$Se.
