abstract: 
  We present results from a search for neutrinoless double-$\beta$(0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay using 36.6 g of the isotope $^{150}$Nd with data corresponding to a live time of 5.25 y recorded with the NEMO-3 detector. We construct a complete background model for this isotope, including a measurement of the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay half-life of $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[9.34 \pm 0.22(\textrm{stat})+0.62-0.60 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{18}$ y for the ground state transition, which represents the most precise result to date for this isotope. We perform a multivariate analysis to search for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decays in order to improve the sensitivity and, in the case of observation, disentangle the possible underlying decay mechanisms. As no evidence for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay is observed, we derive lower limits on half-lives for several mechanisms involving physics beyond the standard model. The observed lower limit, assuming light Majorana neutrino exchange mediates the decay, is $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}\geq 2.0\times 10^{22}$ y at the 90% C.L., corresponding to an upper limit on the effective neutrino mass of $\left < m_\nu \right > \leq 1.6-5.3$ eV.
