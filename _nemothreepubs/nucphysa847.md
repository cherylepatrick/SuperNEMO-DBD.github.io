abstract: 
  Using 9.4 g of $^{96}$Zr  isotope and 1221 days of data from the NEMO-3 detector corresponding to 0.031 kgâ€‰y, the obtained 2$\nu\beta\beta$ decay half-life measurement is $T^{2\nu}_{1/2} = \left[2.35 \pm 0.14(\textrm{stat})\pm0.16 (\textrm{syst})\right]\times 10^{19} \textrm{yr}$.Different characteristics of the final state electrons have been studied, such as the energy sum, individual electron energy, and angular distribution. The 2$\nu$ nuclear matrix element is extracted using the measured 2$\nu\beta\beta$ half-life and is $M^{2\nu}=0.049\pm0.002$. Constraints on 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay have also been set.
