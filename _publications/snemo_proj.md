  Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\beta\beta (0 \nu)$) is the most sensitive process in the search for leptonic number violation and its discovery would prove that the neutrino is a Majorana particle. From the experience of the NEMO-3 detector construction and data analysis, the NEMO Collaboration proposes a three-year R&D program in order to design a detector (SuperNEMO) sensitive to a $\beta\beta (0 \nu)$ period of few 10$^{26}$ yr coupling track reconstruction and calorimeter.
