Our paper on the "Search for Neutrinoless Quadruple-$\beta$ Decay of $^{150}$Nd with the NEMO-3 Detector", led by Dr Pawel Guzowski of the University of Manchester, has been chosen as an Editor's Selection by Physical Review Letters. This is the first search for a decay mode predicted by some theories, which would violate lepton number conservation by four units. No evidence of the decay was seen, enabling us to set a limit on the half life for the process.
