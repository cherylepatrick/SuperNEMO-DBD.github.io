![Dr Michele Cascella of UCL]({{ site.url }}/assets/post_images/Michele_Cascella.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;width:150px;"}UCL researcher Michele Cascella gave a presentation on the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments at the [TIPP'17](http://tipp2017.ihep.ac.cn) conference. TIPP'17, the International Conference on Technology and Instrumentation in Particle Physics, took place in Beijing, China from May 22-26, 2017. Its focus was on detector development and instrumentation in particle physics, astro-particle physics and closely related fields. Michele's talk highlighted the NEMO detectors' fully-instrumented tracker-calorimeter design, and its unique advantage in being able to construct the full double-beta decay event topology, including timing and particle tagging, to virtually eliminate backgrounds. He also showcased the improvements in the SuperNEMO design, focussing on the innovative techniques used to dramatically reduce contamination from radon.
