Congratulations to Dr Xin Ran Liu, who defended his PhD thesis today, supervised by Professor Ruben Saakyan of University College London. Xin studied the effect of radon on SuperNEMO, studying the radiopure components that will lead to the ultra-low-background detector that we will need to make precision measurements of double beta decays.
