   Neutrinos are ubiquitous, but mysterious. A Nobel prize was awarded this year for the discovery that they have mass, and undergo quantum oscillations as they travel - discoveries that fundamentally changed our understanding of physics and cosmology. A rare nuclear decay, being searched for now, might lead to a similar revolution...
